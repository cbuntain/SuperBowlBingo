SuperBowlBingo
==============

Use ImageMagick and a collection of images you populate to create randomized bingo cards

Put your own images into the ./imgs folder. They will be automatically resized for use in the bingo card. These resized images will be stored in the tabs folder.

./board.pdf is the source board on which your images will be placed. If you change it, be sure to update the cell offsets and sizes in the builder file.
